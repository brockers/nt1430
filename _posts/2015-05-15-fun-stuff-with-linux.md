Just for fun figure out how to do something new in Linux.  Everything listed should be free and fairly easy to google.

# Do 3 of the following

* Install celestia, and take a screenshot of earth from one of the moons of Jupiter.
* Create a virtual machine (any OS you choose) using VirtualBox.
* Setup and play a game of Alien Arena (yum search alienarena.)
* Create your own public/private keys using GnuPG (or kgpg for the GUI version.)  Upload your public key to a key server.
* Hide an encrypted message inside a photo using steghide or SteGUI
* Make a photo looks old and stained using the Gimp.
* Add and alternative desktop (like blackbox) and login to it.
* Install kturle and create a picture of a flower using the Logo Programming Language.
